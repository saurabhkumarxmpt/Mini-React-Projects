In this GitHub repository, you'll find several mini React projects that I created while learning React.js. These projects showcase my growing skills in React development and web development in general. Each project demonstrates different aspects of React, including state management, component architecture, and integration with Tailwind CSS for styling. Additionally, you'll see how I apply modern web development practices and solve common challenges encountered in React applications. Explore the repository to get a sense of my proficiency and approach to building dynamic and responsive web applications
