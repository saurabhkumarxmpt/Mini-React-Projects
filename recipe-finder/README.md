# Recipe Finder Using API

This is a simple Recipe Finder app that I created using the TheMealDB API, which is an excellent resource for projects like this. The web app has two pages: the first one is the home page, where users can search for recipes, and the second one is the recipe detail page, which provides all the details about the selected recipe. 

## Demo
