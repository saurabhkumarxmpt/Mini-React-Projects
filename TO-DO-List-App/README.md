# TO-DO-List App


This is a simple to-do list application built with React.js and Tailwind CSS. In this to-do list, you can add, delete, edit, and mark tasks as completed. I also incorporated FontAwesome icons to enhance the user interface. This project showcases my skills in React and Tailwind CSS
